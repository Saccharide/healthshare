# HealthShare
HealthShare is a POC for securely sharing patient-provided information among patients, providers, and various healthcare organizations. Although standards like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) exist for uniformly encoding patient data, there isn't a uniform or consistent platform to data from a consumer/patient standpoint. HealthShare aims to fill in that gap using a structured P2P, encrypted file sharing system backed by Blockchain technology to guarantee data authenticity and integrity.
